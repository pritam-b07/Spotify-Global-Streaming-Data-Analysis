# Spotify-Global-Streaming-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Spotifyâ€™s 2024 global streaming dataset to uncover key trends in music consumption across different countries and genres. Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the analysis provides insights into listener behavior, artist and genre performance, and potential revenue forecasting.

The dataset includes 500 records with detailed information such as country, artist, genre, release year, total streams, monthly listeners, skip rate, and average stream duration.

The analysis covers:

Yearly release trends, highlighting a spike in new music releases during 2020.

Top-performing artists by country, identifying market leaders in different regions.

Genre popularity patterns, showing regional preferences with Pop and Hip-Hop leading globally.

Listener engagement metrics, using boxplots to visualize listener volume across genres and countries.

Revenue forecasting, estimating potential earnings based on stream volume (using a $0.003 per stream model).

Key insights include the strong global appeal of Pop and Hip-Hop, regional variations in genre preference, and mismatches between engagement and revenue potential. Based on these findings, the project recommends optimizing content strategy by country, investing in high-potential artists, and improving user experience to reduce skip rates.

This project showcases effective data storytelling and strategic thinking for digital music platforms aiming to enhance user engagement and revenue.
